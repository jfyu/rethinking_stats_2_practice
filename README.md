# Statistical Rethinking 

My practice notebooks in both R and Python for working through the problems to the book _Statistical Rethinking_ by Richard McElreath, second edition. 

I do follow [pymc resource on this book](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources/tree/main/Rethinking_2) for the pymc guidance and as reference to answers. This is also to familiarize myself with pymc4

Another source to follow is [Jeffrey Girard's blog](https://jmgirard.com/statistical-rethinking-ch3/) for R source codes. I'm not familiar with R so this is helpful.
